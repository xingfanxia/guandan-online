# Guandan Online (掼蛋联机)

Real online multiplayer **Guandan** (掼蛋) — landscape-first web game for 4 / 6 / 8 players.

## Status

🚧 **P0 Foundation in progress** (week 1-2 of an 8-week plan). Bootstrap + auth bridge + half of the rules engine landed 2026-05-17. See [`HANDOFF.md`](HANDOFF.md) for current progress and [`docs/plan/PLAN.md`](docs/plan/PLAN.md) for the full 31-milestone roadmap.

## Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Frontend | Vite 8 + React 19 + TypeScript 6 (strict mode, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`) |
| Backend | Vercel `/api/*.ts` serverless functions on Fluid Compute (`nodejs22.x`, 300s timeout) |
| Transport | SSE + POST + Upstash Redis pub/sub (NOT Colyseus / PartyKit) — locked per `docs/research/realtime-sync-deep-dive.md` |
| Persistence | Upstash Redis (shared instance with sibling scorer; namespaced keys) |
| Tests | Vitest 4 + V8 coverage (95%+ target on `lib/game/*`) |
| AI | 3 tiers: Easy (rule-based + noise), Medium (rule + WASM solver), Hard (DeepSeek LLM via Vercel AI Gateway) |
| Domain | `gdo.ax0x.ai` (sibling subdomain to scorer at `gd.ax0x.ai`) |

## Local development

```bash
npm install              # 81 packages, 0 vulnerabilities
npm run dev              # Vite dev server on :5174
npm test                 # vitest run (111 tests as of P0 kickoff)
npm run typecheck        # tsc -b
npm run test:coverage    # V8 coverage; outputs to coverage/
```

Copy `.env.example` → `.env.local` and fill in Upstash + admin token values for any code path that hits KV.

## Sibling project

The companion scoring app lives at [`../guandan-scorer`](../guandan-scorer) — it tracks team progression, honors, rooms, and player profiles for in-person play. This repo is the actual playable game. Shared `@handle` namespace (Option B) means a user's profile follows them across both apps.

## License

TBD — to be decided before public launch.
